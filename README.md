# Practicum Data Science Project
## Machine Learning for Oil Exploration

### Description
Working for an oil mining company called OilyGiant, the task is to find a suitable location for drilling a new oil well. The following are the steps to select a new location:

Collect parameters to build an oil well in several selected regions: oil quality and oil reserve volume;
Create a model that can predict the volume of oil reserves in a new well;
Select the oil well with the highest estimated value;
Select the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil well.
You have oil sample data from three regions. The parameters of each oil well in those regions are already known. Create a model that will help you choose the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze the potential profit and risks using the bootstrapping technique.

### Objectives
The objectives of this research are:
1. Creating a model that can predict the volume of oil reserves in a new well;
2. Selecting the oil well with the highest estimated value;
3. Selecting the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil well.
